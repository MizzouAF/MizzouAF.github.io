    Good morning from Europe! My name is Jared Hall, and I am a Learning Technologies and Design graduate student. This is my second term here at Mizzou. I am originally from Webb City, Missouri and for the last 18 years have served as a meteorologist with the U.S. Air Force. Currently, I'm deployed to Europe and will be taking the entirety of this course while deployed. I have two associate degrees in Electronics Technology and Meteorology and earned my B.S. in Geography from Park University. However, most of my career has been in training and developing others which led me back to Mizzou and the LTD program. This is my first adventure into web development. I hope to be able to use this course to further a career in instructional design. In my spare time, I like to hike, hunt, kayak, and spend time with my girlfriend Kellie, my family, and my friends. I wish you all the best of luck in the class.
