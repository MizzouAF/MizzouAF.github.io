        <main><h3> About Me</h3>
        <p>My name is Jared Hall. I grew up in Southwest Missouri, where the Ozarks meet the prairie and the weather gets very interesting. 
            This developed a passion for the natural world, and for the last 18 years I have served in the United States Air Force. 
            Thirteen of those years, I have worked as a Meteorologist. 
            However, most of my career has been in training and developing others.
            Mostly, I have been assigned the task of training and certifying junior Airmen for weather deployments around the globe.</p>
            <p>This love of teaching and training is what has led me back to Mizzou and the LTD program. 
            This is my first adventure into web development. I hope to be able to use this course to further a career in instructional design.
            In my spare time, I like to hike, hunt, kayak, and spend time with my girlfriend Kellie, my family, and my friends.</p>
            <p> I have two associate degrees in Electronics Technology and Meteorology from the Community College of the Air Force. 
                I also graduated Magna Cum Laude from Park University with a Bachelor of Science in Geography. 
                Currently, I am a Learning Technologies and Design graduate major at the University of Missouri. 
                My estimated graduation date is Spring 2024.</p>
