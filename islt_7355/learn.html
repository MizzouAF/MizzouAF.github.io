            Clouds give us an amazing understanding of the current stability of the atmosphere. 
            Different cloud types mean the atmosphere is stable or unstable. This gives us a huge clue as to what kind of 
            weather we can expect to see in the near future. In this section students will learn how to successfully analyze 
            and explain the current nature of the atmosphere by determining which cloud type they are viewing.

            rain and snow precipitation types and understand how precipittion correlates to the overall stability of Earth’s atmosphere.
